# react-netflix-pages

What's new since I built my last React app? What isn't?!

## Github Goes 2-Factor

I need 2-factor authentication now to use Github? Ok, check. But the next time I tried to update my repo BOOM -- I didn't have a token. All of this makes sense since security is an ever-evolving issue, but it took a little time to figure out how to navigate the changes.

## React Hooks

I haven't used these, but in the last 24 hours I've learned they're the greatest thing since React itself. 

## Day 2 Status

My React knowledge needs brushing up. But I'm excited that I found a great tutorial that factors in all the updates and I'm learning again. Barring another pandemic or Godzilla showing up, I'm going to indulge my newly reinvigorated desire to learn React. Hooks -- here I come! :neckbeard:
